## Jake D'Esposito

I wrote the code for changing the position of the object, either via mouse click or wasd key presses. I also wrote the code for increasing and decreasing the speed of the object.

## Ethan Arnold

I finished the code that moved the object. I implemented a vector that is multiplied against to give direction of the object, as well as reimplementing the speed button to be a base speed multiplied by a real number in which is increased or decreased. I wrote code for defining the polygon by star vertices.
